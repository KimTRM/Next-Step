# NextStep
> Helping you take your next step in life.

**NextStep** is a jobseeker and mentorship platform designed for students, graduating students, and young jobseekers. It helps users transition into employment with proper guidance, mentorship, and clarity, rather than leaving them to navigate the job market alone.

**Track:** Social Services · Youth Development  
**Status:** Prototype / MVP

## 🎯 Overview
Youth employment is not only an economic issue, but also a social development challenge. Many young people struggle to enter the workforce not because of lack of ability, but due to limited access to guidance, mentors, and clear opportunities.

NextStep addresses this gap by combining job discovery with mentorship and structured guidance, helping young people feel prepared, confident, and supported throughout their job search journey.

---

## 🧩 Problem
Students and first-time jobseekers often face:
- Lack of clear guidance on where and how to apply  
- Limited access to mentors or experienced professionals  
- Low confidence and unfamiliarity with hiring processes  

As a result, job hunting becomes overwhelming, inefficient, and discouraging, contributing to youth unemployment and underemployment.

---

## 💡 Solution
NextStep is a **Jobseeker & Mentorship Hub** that guides users step by step through the job search process.

Instead of focusing only on job listings, the platform emphasizes:
- Career readiness  
- Mentorship and guidance  
- Confidence-building for first-time jobseekers  

---

## ✨ Core MVP Features
- User profiles (skills, interests, career goals)  
- Student-friendly job and company listings  
- Application tracking dashboard  
- Mentor matching and in-app messaging

### Secondary Users

## 🔄 Conceptual System Flow
1. User creates a personal profile  
2. System matches the user with relevant jobs and mentors  
3. User applies for jobs and tracks application status  
4. Mentors provide guidance, feedback, and career advice  

The system flow is intentionally simple to ensure clarity, accessibility, and ease of use.

## 🌱 Social Impact
NextStep aligns with the **Social Services (Youth Development)** track by:
- Supporting youth career readiness  
- Providing guidance and mentorship, not just job access  
- Reducing information and access gaps for first-time jobseekers  
- Helping young people make informed and confident career decisions  

This positions NextStep as a **social support platform**, not merely a job application tool.
